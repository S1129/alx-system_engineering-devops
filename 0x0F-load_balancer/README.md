Project Description
This project aims to improve our web stack by introducing redundancy for our web servers, allowing us to handle more traffic and enhance infrastructure reliability. We'll achieve this by configuring two additional servers: web-02 and lb-01.

Concepts
For this project, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

Load balancer
Web stack debugging
Background Context
You've been provided with two additional servers: gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX and gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX. The goal is to configure these servers to achieve redundancy for our web servers and improve infrastructure reliability.

Resources
Before you start, it's recommended to read or watch the following resources:

Introduction to load-balancing and HAproxy
HTTP header
Debian/Ubuntu HAProxy packages
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
Your Servers
Name, Username, IP, and State:
91903-web-01, ubuntu, 54.197.105.254, running
91903-web-02
91903-lb-01
Tasks
1. Double the Number of Webservers
Mandatory | Score: 0.0% Configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Automate this process by writing a Bash script. Additionally, configure Nginx on both web-01 and web-02 to include a custom HTTP response header, X-Served-By, with the server's hostname.

Requirements:
Configure Nginx on web-01 and web-02 to include a custom HTTP header
Custom HTTP header name: X-Served-By
Custom HTTP header value: The hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response_header script to configure a new Ubuntu machine to meet these requirements
Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 54.89.38.100 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-02
sylvain@ubuntu$
2. Install Your Load Balancer
Mandatory | Score: 0.0% Install and configure HAproxy on lb-01 server. Configure HAproxy to distribute traffic evenly between web-01 and web-02 using a round-robin algorithm. Ensure HAproxy can be managed via an init script.

Requirements:
Configure HAproxy to distribute traffic to web-01 and web-02
Use a round-robin algorithm for load balancing
Ensure HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Ensure your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -Is 54.210.47.110
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Mon, 27 Feb 2017 06:12:17 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
...
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
Accept-Ranges: bytes
3. Add a Custom HTTP Header with Puppet (Advanced)
Advanced | Score: 0.0% Automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, similar to task #1, but with Puppet.

Requirements:
Name of the custom HTTP header: X-Served-By
Value of the custom HTTP header: The hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp script to c
